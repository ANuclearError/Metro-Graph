###Motivation###
This is an second, individual implementation of the 'Multi-Graph ADT' group
assignment in class CS308 in the Computer Science course the University of 
Strathclyde, Glasgow. My submitted version only achieved a 50% grade, so this is
an attempt to improve the previous submission, which is not publicly available.
I have undertaken it as a solo project because I feel I would do better as a
result.
